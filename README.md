#supabase #vuejs #compositionapi

sample application using composition api to create "hooks" to interact with the supabase api. This is a work in progress, but wanted to show the approach I used which might inspire some one to go all the way... this isn't using typescript which I think would be a great next step.

Check out the source code and leave comments below if you think this is something I should keep going on.
